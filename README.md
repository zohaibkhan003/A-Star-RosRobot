# A-Star-RosRobot

  This project will utilize many methods to complete one ultimate goal. First, a PID controller will be used to make sure the appropriate turns will be made dependent on the desired angle. PD controllers compensate for error of an overshoot of a system to produce optimal results.
  Second, a third degree polynomial can be used for waypoint navigation to allow the robot to get to its waypoint. 
  Lastly, the A star algorithm will be used to find the least expensive node and the fast route to take to get from start to end poin
